Each product can be installed in one day 					without IPLs, and implementation can be achieved by non technical personnel, scheduling and tracking events, within the 					first day after installation. Each product was driven by a keyed knowledge base accessed through an online interface written 					using ISPF. Languages used were Assembler and Cobol.<br><br>					Job/Master - automated job scheduling.<br>					Comprehensive, full featured job scheduling product. Calendar and keyword scheduling language for ease of implementation, all 					events supported, including data set triggers, job/step triggers, console commands, step-level condition-code validation.  					Competitive with CA-7, Jobtrac, ZEKE and others.<br><br>					Console/Master - console automation<br>					Console monitoring allowing automatic replies to messages, message modification/replacement, issue commands, interact with the 					job scheduling system. Console interaction is based on computer speed, not human interaction, reducing overall run times. 					Competitive with OPS/MVS, ODDS, etc.<br><br>					Run/Master - JCL rerun restart automation<br>					This software provides the means for automatically restarting a failed job, accounting for all MVS catalog maintenance, 					dataset maintenance, and GDG bias adjustments for job reruns. Complete jobs or step restarts are easily handled. This product 					is competitive with CA-11, however, no system JCL control blocks were modified. All restart information was handled at the JCL 					level and manual modifications were available through the online interface prior to submission, if desired.<br><br>					Tape/2000 - tape management<br>					Monitors, manages, and records all tape processing, real-time, assigning and providing overwrite protection based on user 					defined criteria. All forms of retention definition are available, GDG, versions, EXPDT, RETPD. Knowledge base definitions 					can be assigned by full specific DSN or least specific allowing for wild card * definitions. There were no hard modifications 					to the OS. OPEN/CLOSE/EOV modules were modified, (in memory), at subsystem startup. Ageing and offsite cycling, for disaster 					recovery, was supported. TAPE2000 allows users to account for every tape in your datacenter, whether it is in your library or 					at a disaster recovery/offsite vault.<a class="showhide" href="#" rel="c">close</a>				</div>		  </li>          <li>Capacity Planning and performance tuning of MVS systems.		      <a class="showhide" href="#" rel="o">open/close</a>		  		<div class="slideDiv">					Conducted presentations at all levels of management, producing supporting data and statistics as visual aids.<br><br>					Responsible for tuning and capacity planning in a multi-CPU environment using hardware monitors, Omegamon, SLR, 					SMF/RMF, DB2 transaction data, and GTF.<br><br>					IMS transaction times were dramatically improved by restructuring transaction classes, with some response times going 					from minutes to seconds.<br><br> 					Responsible for defining and adjusting performance control values in SYS1.PARMLIB IPS, ICS and OPT members.<br><br>					Improvements to tune the environment and eliminate bottlenecks, improving throughput, caused hardware upgrades to be deferred.<br><br>										Responsible for developing a data center charge back system allowing user departments to account for their portion of 					system usage.

This system, written mainly using SAS, collected resource data such 					as, transaction times, CPU, job turn around time, up-time, and reported negotiated vs. achieved service levels. This data, 					with the charge back data, was used to negotiate new required service levels based on equipment upgrades.					<a class="showhide" href="#" rel="c">close</a>				</div>		  		  </li>          <li>Trouble-shooting and debugging of operating systems and application systems.		      <a class="showhide" href="#" rel="o">open/close</a>		  		<div class="slideDiv">					Provided extensive systems-related troubleshooting using native dumps and IPCS dump analysis and GTF traces. 					Also assisted in solving applications-related abends using native dumps and Abend-AID.<br><br> 					Developed REXX application, analyzing network data real time, which allowed operations personnel to be the first level of research/correction for 					network hangs reducing the mean time to repair. <a class="showhide" href="#" rel="c">close</a>				</div>		  </li>		  		  <li>MVS operating systems installation, modification and management.		      <a class="showhide" href="#" rel="o">open/close</a>		  		<div class="slideDiv">					Gave presentation, at IBM conference, on the issues and technical ease with which the MVS/ESA system can be implemented.<br><br>										Lead person responsible for installation, customization and general system-level support for all IBM mainframe Operating 					Systems and supporting software.
