<p><b><i><font size="4" face="arial">TECHNICAL SUMMARY</font></i></b></p>

<p><b><font size="3" face="arial">Web site development.</font> </b></p>

<blockquote>Dynamic web site design and programming using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery. Personal experience includes C# programming.
</blockquote>

<p><b><font size="3" face="arial">Design/Development of IBM mainframe software products for commercial use.</font> </b></p>

<blockquote>These software products required no OS modifications, using only standard OS exits. Each product can be installed in one day without 
IPLs, and implementation can be achieved by non technical personnel, scheduling and tracking events, within the first day after installation.
 Each product was driven by a keyed knowledge base accessed through an online interface written using ISPF. Languages used were Assembler and 
 Cobol.
<blockquote>
<b>Job/Master - automated job scheduling.</b><br />
Comprehensive, full featured job scheduling product. Calendar and keyword scheduling language for ease of implementation, all events supported, 
including data set triggers, job/step triggers, console commands, step-level condition-code validation. Competitive with CA-7, Jobtrac, ZEKE and 
others.<br />
<br />
<b>Console/Master - console automation</b><br />
Console monitoring allowing automatic replies to messages, message modification/replacement, issue commands, interact with the job scheduling 
system. Console interaction is based on computer speed, not human interaction, reducing overall run times. Competitive with OPS/MVS, ODDS, etc.<br />
<br />
<b>Run/Master - JCL rerun restart automation</b><br />
This software provides the means for automatically restarting a failed job, accounting for all MVS catalog maintenance, dataset maintenance, and 
GDG bias adjustments for job reruns. Complete jobs or step restarts are easily handled. This product is competitive with CA-11, however, no 
system JCL control blocks were modified. All restart information was handled at the JCL level and manual modifications were available through the 
online interface prior to submission, if desired.<br />
<br />
<b>Tape/2000 - tape management<br />
</b>Monitors, manages, and records all tape processing, real-time, assigning and providing overwrite protection based on user defined criteria. 
All forms of retention definition are available, GDG, versions, EXPDT, RETPD. Knowledge base definitions can be assigned by full specific DSN or 
least specific allowing for wild card * definitions. There were no hard modifications to the OS. OPEN/CLOSE/EOV modules were modified, 
(in memory), at subsystem startup. Ageing and offsite cycling, for disaster recovery, was supported. TAPE2000 allows users to account for 
every tape in your datacenter, whether it is in your library or at a disaster recovery/offsite vault.</blockquote></blockquote>

<p><b><font size="3" face="arial">Capacity Planning and performance tuning of MVS systems </font> </b></p>

<blockquote>Conducted presentations at all levels of management, producing supporting data and statistics as visual aids.<br />
<br />
Responsible for tuning and capacity planning in a multi-CPU environment using hardware monitors, Omegamon, SLR, SMF/RMF, DB2 transaction data, 
and GTF.<br />
<br />
IMS transaction times were dramatically improved by restructuring transaction classes, with some response times going from minutes to seconds.<br />
<br />
Responsible for defining and adjusting performance control values in SYS1.PARMLIB IPS, ICS and OPT members.<br />
<br />
Improvements to tune the environment and eliminate bottlenecks, improving throughput, caused hardware upgrades to be deferred.<br />
<br />
Responsible for developing a data center charge back system allowing user departments to account for their portion of system usage. 
This system was developed using the JARS product with extensive user modifications. Modifications were user exits written in Assembler language.<br />
<br />
Developed data center Service Level Reporting system. This system, written mainly using SAS, collected resource data such as, transaction times, 
CPU, job turn around time, up-time, and reported negotiated vs. achieved service levels. This data, with the charge back data, was used to 
negotiate new required service levels based on equipment upgrades.</blockquote>

<p><b><font size="3" face="arial">Trouble-shooting and debugging of operating systems and application systems.</font> </b></p>

<blockquote>Provided extensive systems-related troubleshooting using native dumps and IPCS dump analysis and GTF traces. Also assisted in solving 
applications-related abends using native dumps and Abend-AID.<br />
<br />
Developed REXX application, analyzing network data real time, which allowed operations personnel to be the first level of research/correction 
for network hangs reducing the mean time to repair.</blockquote>

<p><b><font size="3" face="arial">MVS operating systems installation, modification and management.</font> </b></p>

<blockquote>Gave presentation, at IBM conference, on the issues and technical ease with which the MVS/ESA system can be implemented.<br />
<br />
Lead person responsible for installation, customization and general system-level support for all IBM mainframe Operating Systems and supporting 
software. Had sole responsibility for converting from VS1 to MVS operating system in a multi-CPU environment using SMP/E.<br />
<br />
Experienced in modifications to operating system components and writing system exits.<br />
<br />
Systems programming manager for a team of 5 systems programmers responsible for </p>

<p>installation/customization and general system-level support for all data center systems software in a distributed environment.</blockquote

<p><b><font size="3" face="arial">Business application developer </font> </b></p>

<blockquote>Part of a team responsible for technical design and programming of Order Processing and General Ledger systems using Cobol.</blockquote>
